Trace a piece of paper to fit along the bottom

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:16.700
Tape the paper inside the box and seal the top.

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:24.860
Cut rectangular holes on the left and right of the top.

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:29.020
Cut a piece of aluminum foil to cover the left hole. Tape in place.

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:33.110
Poke a pinhole in the center of the foil.

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:40.900
With the sun behind you, look into the right hole.
